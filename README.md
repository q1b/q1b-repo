##### Q1B-REPO Basically, a monorepo

## What is monorepo ?

A monorepo is a single repository containing multiple distinct projects, with well-defined relationships. ~ [monorepo.tools](https://monorepo.tools/)

Found it interesting to share and built stuff and almost got lost into management and just keep it all at one place looks more feasible,

### Tools Used for this Monorepo,

- tool: [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)
- web-based repository: [github](https://www.github.com)
- package manager: npm [https://www.npmjs.com/]
- git-feature: git submodules

### Directory Structure

- `apps`: all the website and documentation will exists here!
- `packages`: shared configs and npm packages exists here!

### Contribution Guide

Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of `git`

Nothing more!, for every contribution myself can't be more happy!
